## Moodle

This repo was used as a test environment for dockerising Moodle (http://moodle.com) for using on the Learner's Block (https://learnersblock.org) App Store. It is a working build that can be run locally using docker-compose. 

Moodle setup is not easy to work with so have left this repo here as an example for others.

Set the hostname in the docker-comopse file. It is current 0.0.0.0 for running localling. Run `docker-compose up` and access Moodle by visiting `http://0.0.0.0`, or the hostname you set in the docker-compose file.

## Description
